##  SSL Global Context
##
##  All SSL configuration in this context applies both to
##  the main server and all SSL-enabled virtual hosts.
##

# These are the configuration directives to instruct the server how to
# serve pages over an https connection. For detailing information about these
# directives see <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html>
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.

# This global SSL configuration is ignored if 
# "SSL" is not defined, or if "NOSSL" is defined.

	#   SSLHonorCipherOrder
	#   If SSLHonorCipherOrder is disabled, then the client's preferences
	#   for chosing the cipher during the TLS handshake are used.
	#   If set to on, then the above SSLCipherSuite is used, in the order
	#   given, with the first supported match on both ends.

	#   implementation as determined by the platform and APR.

	#   WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
	#   is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
	#   because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
	#   it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
	#   platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
	#   block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
	#   Manual for more details.
