% DEPRICATED!!! MOVE TO NODE.

% Commont Routine
% Provide Feature scoped strings to DRY the code
g(Item) ->
  bdd_utils:log(depricate, "DEPRICATED: Please use node instead of nodeS for this call ~p",[g]),
  node:g(Item).
  
% Common Routine
% Makes sure that the JSON conforms to expectations (only tests deltas)
validate(JSON) ->
  bdd_utils:log(depricate, "DEPRICATED: Please use node instead of nodeS for this call ~p",[validate]),
  node:validate(JSON).

% Common Routine
% Returns list of nodes in the system to check for bad housekeeping
inspector(Config) -> 
  bdd_utils:log(depricate, "DEPRICATED: Please use node instead of nodeS for this call ~p",[inspector]),
  node:inspector(Config).
  
% Common Routine
% Creates JSON used for POST/PUT requests
json(Name, Description, Order) ->
  bdd_utils:log(depricate, "DEPRICATED: Please use node instead of nodeS for this call ~p",[json]),
  node:json(Name, Description, Order).  

step(Config, Input, Step) ->
  bdd_utils:log(depricate, "DEPRICATED: Please use node instead of nodeS for this call ~p: ~p",[step, Step]),
  node:step(Config, Input, Step).
