# This needs to be in sync with the boot.rb. First we activate 
# specific versions for the gems, and afterwards we require all gems. 
# That's the best workaround for the usage of bundler. This Gemfile
# is used for a simple gem installation only, we are not using 
# bundle exec anymore on this project!
