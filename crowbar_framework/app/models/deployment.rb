# A 'deployment' of a barclamp represents a deployed (or deployable) cluster of the 
# barclamp's technology (e.g. mySql, NTP, openstack Nova, etc)
# It has a ""history"" of deployment snapshots that were created and applied.
#
# 'snapshots' is the history relation. It contains all historical deployments.
# active_snapshot is the currently active proposal snapshot (or queued or committing)
# proposed_snapshot is the most recently editted/created snapshot. (It might not be applied).
