# A 'deployment' of a barclamp represents a deployed (or deployable) cluster of roles 
#
# 'snapshots' is the history relation. It contains all historical deployments.
# active_snapshot is the currently active proposal snapshot (or queued or committing)
# proposed_snapshot is the most recently editted/created snapshot. (It might not be applied).
