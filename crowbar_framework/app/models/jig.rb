  #  Find the right snapshot to use for applying the given deployment.
  # At this point, there's one - return it.
  # Some future possible directions:
  #   - Choose jig type by the barclamp being applied - allows different barclamps
  #     to be implemented using different technologies
  #   - Choose a jig snapshot, by node location. Could allow mixing jig domains
  #     where different snapshots (probably of the same type) manage different 
  #     domains of nodes
