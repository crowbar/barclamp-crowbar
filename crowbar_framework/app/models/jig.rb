=begin
  The Jig (base class) provides abstract interface for jig implementations. The general pattern
  is  that the base class provides class methods, that either:
   - locate the appropriate Jig instance and call the instance method on them
   - call the respective instance method on all jig's

  The exact pattern depends on the operation - some operations are 'broadcast' in nature, 
  while some should only target a particular jig instance.

=begin
  Utility method to iterate over jigs, and callback to  the mandatory block.
  If an error occurs on one jig, iteration continues to others.
  Jigs are left to manage thier own transactions - if one jig failes, the 
  others should not be impacted (hence no over arching transaction)
