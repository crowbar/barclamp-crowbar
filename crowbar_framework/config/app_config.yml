# Disable the use of Bundler for managing Gems by default (for Crowbar 1.x), as
# it has been deemed to be too risky at this point of the release. This means
# Gemfile and Gemfile.lock are ignored by default. Crowbar 2.x and above uses
# Rails 3, which forces the use of Bundler so we don't have/need this option there.
use_bundler: false

# Within this section we will define all branding related stuff. You can define a
# custom copyright, custom logos and custom titles for various places.
branding:
  # The main page title that gets displayed on all pages on the top bar and within
  # the meta information.
  page_title: 'Crowbar'

  # The page slogan is an optional value. If you don't define it nothings gets
  # printed out. If you define it, it gets printed as a suffix for the page title.

  # This configuration entry can get used to customize the version name output.
  # SUSE Cloud for example should write something like SUSE Cloud v2.0, whereas
  # Crowbar on Dell side writes Version 0.0.1. The variable CROWBAR_VERSION gets
  # replaced by the constant value.
