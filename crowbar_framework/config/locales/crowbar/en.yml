          Upgrading is a multistep process. The first few steps of this process are still
          done using the SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5 version of the Administration Server. After
          that you will be asked to reinstall the Server with SUSE OpenStack Cloud 6, where
          the rest of the upgrade Process is performed.
          At some point during the upgrade the OpenStack Cloud will be turned off and all
          cloud services will be inaccessible.
          It is highly recommended to back up data before the upgrade.

          As a first step all client nodes of this setup need to be prepared to allow the
          administration server to be upgraded. Click 'Prepare Nodes for Upgrade' to start
          that preparation. It is still possible to revert the Upgrade Process after that.

          Click 'Download Upgrade Data' and keep that tar archive in a secure place. You
          will be asked to upload it later on in the process.
          After you downloaded and saved the upgrade data click 'Continue Upgrade Process'.

          As the next step in the upgrade process you need to redeploy the
          Administration Server
          with the new version of SUSE OpenStack Cloud. Please make sure to redeploy on
          the very same machine using the same network configuration as before.
          Note, after redeploying it is not possible anymore to get back to
          SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5.
        question: |
          Please reassure that you successfully downloaded the upgrade data
          and continue the upgrade process by redeploying the Administration Server.
          After that, open the Web Interface again and select the
          'Continue Upgrade Process' option in the installation wizard.
