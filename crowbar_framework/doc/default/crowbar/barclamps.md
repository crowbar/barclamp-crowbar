# Barclamps

This book is a composite of information from the barclamps installed in the Crowbar Framework. Each barclamp is 
expected to populate information into this book; consequently, the contents are variable depending on which barclamps 
have been installed.


## What is a barclamp?

A barclamp is a module in Crowbar that provides specific functionality for the system. Barclamps cannot operate without
