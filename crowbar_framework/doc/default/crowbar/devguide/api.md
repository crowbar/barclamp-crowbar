## Crowbar API

This document is the reference guide for the Crowbar 2.0 API

### Using the API

The Crowbar API is RESTful and accepts/returns JSON.  While some arguments may return XML as an option, it is NOT a supported output.

The Crowbar API is versioned.  API urls include the Crowbar version of the API (e.g.: 1.0 or 2.0).  Please use the most highest version available!

> Legacy Note: some routes maintain a 1.0 API; however, these should all be considered deprecated!
