#### Topic Documentation

Markdown is the current format.

Path is `doc/default/barclamp/file.md`

It is recommended to use additional subdirectories!  Simply add another `/` to the same to indicate another level of depth on the file path.  Ideally, each markdown file is only about 1 page of text.

> The naming of topics will match the file paths!

The name of the topic is expected to start with a # title flag.  This title is used by the generator to create the displayed title.

It is recommended to use # for top level (book), ## for second level (section), ### for third level (topic) and so on.
