## Configuration Managers (aka Jigs)

Crowbar provides a pluggable model for interacting with nodes and other infrastructure.  This model is known as the "Jig" function.

The core concept is that Crowbar has 1 or more Jigs that preform the work of Crowbar via Jobs.

For initial Crowbar work, the primary Jig is the Chef jig in Barclamp-Chef.

For testing, Crowbar provides a Test Jig that is included in the core Crowbar barclamp.
