#### Experimental Crowbar Model

![Crowbar Model (image)](crowbar_model.png "Crowbar Model")

#### Required Overrides

The Crowbar system requires that you overide certain models/controllers for it to work

The required overrides are:

* Barclamp[Name]::Barclamp

The optional overrides are:

* Barclamp[Name]::Attrib[SpecialFunction]

#### Overriding Barclamp.rb 

The superclass Barclamp.rb provides everything that you need to operate Crowbar for most functions.  You can override it to create advanced functionality.

##### create_proposal

Notes:
* superclass calls create_deployment

Use this to pre-populate nodes into a new proposal

##### is_valid? deployment

Notes:
* superclass returns true
* called before deployment.commit

##### process_inbound_data

##### transition

This is a critical function, it determines which actions the barclamp takes when it gets new information.

##### versions

Defaults to 2.0
