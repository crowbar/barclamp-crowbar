#Discovering Network Nodes#

To initiate discovery of network nodes:

1. Power on the nodes. They will PXE boot from the Crowbar admin node.
2. Verify nodes statuses in the Crow UI by navigating to *Nodes > Dashboard*, and then ensuring that all nodes' icons are blinking yellow. This indicates that the nodes are ready to be allocated, and utilized in an OpenStack or a Hadoop cluster.

>**Note:** This can take some time; please be patient.
